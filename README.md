# CS50 Web Development Final Project: Fitness Classes
Hi there! This is the repo for my fitness class web app! 

## Functionality
The web app has two main functions: viewing one's current classes and signing up for new ones, and messaging
the instructor in one's classes. The first functionality can be found under "Classes" and the second
can be found under "Messages". Furthermore, the app also has a feature where one can change their profile
picture.

## Tools used
The main tools used were Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For some of the features, such as the 
animations of the current classes and mobile responsiveness, I used some of the more advanced CSS 
properties, such as animations and media tags. Lastly, another tool that was very difficult to learn but 
highly useful was Django Channels. This allowed me to implement web sockets into my app, which allow the web app 
to update in real time.
